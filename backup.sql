I have known dalasis, that is what I call him since 1983 when we were medical students, I''m very sure that only pleasant and brilliantly beautiful things will be said about you and Dupe today. Not only because people love to say good things in occasions like this, but in this case that is really who you are. 

You have a good heart -That is actually bigger than your body. Don''t laugh. 

Your heart is full good things, you love people. I mean, all people you love service to God, your family, colleagues and your community. This is reflected in the number of active philanthropic organisations you founded together and that you have continued to fund. 

So I was confused. And I didn''t know which of them to send my small donation to because yeah, they are all good ones, but, you know, we got talk the donation thing in the way we usually do am, I''m sure you know.
Your family openly receives all people to your home (see "glasnost" in action). 

If you know, you know, my daughter, Dr Kenny Jinadu, was a beneficiary of this openness and she''s there today, representing my family at this wonderful occasion  
However, there is an equally pleasant soul working and walking side by side with you in all of this- let us give a shout out to- you modupe - my sister. And that is detribalised Dallasis for you. I have asked Hecto several times -What time do you ask for my sister? 

Because Dallas is everywhere in the world, all the time, either celebrating or helping to organise some events for individuals, families or organisation safelessly, or he is keeping late nights, doing endless things for people, community, doing health talks and so on and so on, hence i have nicknamed several decades ago as "Kerosene" -I know you will laugh- that needs decoding - if you know, you know? Well, we joyfully welcome you to climbing the 6th floor today and we celebrate your God blessed wife and beautiful children for 30 years of what a happy God family should look like. 
I refer you to exodus 23 vs 25 to 26 because your life is full of service. Happy born day - Dallas is my colleague, my friend and my brother. God bless you and all yours.

Today marks not just a milestone of years but a beautiful testimony of love, partnership, strength, and unwavering commitment. Your journey together continues to inspire everyone privileged to know you.

I want to take a moment to say something from the deepest part of my heart: thank you. Many years ago, your kindness changed the direction of my life in a moment when I felt I had run out of options. At a time when I was almost homeless with a newborn and a five-year-old, you stepped in with generosity, compassion, and love—helping me secure a roof over our heads and giving us the safety and stability we desperately needed. I will never forget that. You didn’t just offer help; you restored hope.

As you celebrate 30 years of marriage—three decades of grace, love, and unity—and as we rejoice with you on this special 60th birthday, I pray your home continues to overflow with peace, joy, health, laughter, and God’s enduring blessings. May the years ahead be even more beautiful than all the years behind you.

Thank you for being a shining example of what true love, true friendship, true kindness and leadership look like.
I celebrate you both today and always.

With gratitude,
Esther', '2025-11-28 13:45:37');
